# zomato rating predictor 

This is a zomato rating predictor. Here, I have worked on a large dataset https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants that has ratings of restaurants on the basis of fields like cuisine,
price for 2, etc. 
The predictor will take inputs from user on these fields and then give predicted rating. 
The major parts of this project have been to :
1) perform extensive EDA on the large data
2) build an appropriate machine learning model to help various zomato restaurants to predict their rating. Hence, they can also improve. 
3) deplot the project. 

This project has further scope of improvement such that we can then tell the client which area they can improve and hence target the process.
